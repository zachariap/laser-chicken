Play Laser Chicken by Zacharia.

# Description

Laser chicken is a game that is man vs computer. To begin the game you are asked to choose a chicken character each with its corresponding ability.
You can utilize the game grid to see where the character is currently and other information such as position, health, latest acton, for both yourself
and the computer. Have fun!

# Goals

The goal of Laser Chicken was to work with Object-Oriented Programming at an introductory level.

# Functionality

Both 'lucky_chicken' and 'blast_chicken' inherit functionality from their parent classes 'defensive_chicken' and 'offensive_chicken', respectively, which both extend the parent class 'chicken_character'. Any offensive chicken class will have doubled damage on the 3rd attack turn. Any defensive chicken will have a 25% chance of blocking 50% of the attackers attack. 'blast_chicken' is an offensive_chicken type with the ability to double its movement. 'lucky_chicken' is a defensive_chicken type, with the ability to regenerate health.

# Drawbacks

This program is simple in its use and needs many layers of complexity to make a feasible product.
